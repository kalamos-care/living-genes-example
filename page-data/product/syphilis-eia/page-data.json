We use an ELISA assay for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to T. pallidum. Since our assay specifically targets antibodies against the organism, patients with previously treated syphilis will still be positive on this test. A positive result may indicate recent, past, or successfully treated syphilis infections, therefore, the test cannot be used to differentiate between active and past cured cases.","descriptionHtml":"Syphilis is a disease caused by infection with the spirochete Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum).
